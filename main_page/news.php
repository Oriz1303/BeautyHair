        <p class=" ">No doubt Jonathan Simkhais Spring 2018 Ready-to-Wear collection had a sense of airiness about it — something weve long been waiting for from one of our favorite designers. Its an essence he carried from head to hip to toe, donning his models in this fabulous windswept twisted half crown that bridged renaissance royalty and carefree boho chic.</p>
        <div class="fs-4">STEP 1:</div>
        <img class="" src="../resources//img//img_news/NYFW2.jpg" width="900" alt="">
        <p>Start by washing with TRESemmé Repair & Protect 7 Shampoo and Conditioner to protect your hair against breakage. Spritz generously with Keratin Smooth Heat Protection Spray and rough dry hair.</p>
        <div class="fs-4">STEP 2:</div>
        <img class="" src="../resources//img//img_news/NYFW3.jpg" width="900" alt="">
        <p>Section into small handfuls and curl tightly around a curling iron, creating ringlets. Repeat until all the hair is curled.</p>
        <div class="fs-4">STEP 3:</div>
        <img class="" src="../resources//img//img_news/NYFW4.jpg" width="900" alt="">
        <p>Break apart and comb out with fingertips, then spray hair all over with TRESemmé Fresh Start Dry Shampoo to create wild texture. <br>
            Take the top half of hair and separate into two sections; twist the sections across each other and knot. Fasten with bobby pins. <br>
            Wrap the ends of your hair from the knot, and pin around the head like a crown.</p>
        <div class="fs-4">STEP 4:</div>
        <img class="" src="../resources//img//img_news/NYFW5.jpg" width="900" alt="">
        <p>To finish, sporadically pull out some fine hairs around the face to frame it, and secure your look with TRESemmé TRESemmé Extra Hold Hair Spray.</p>
